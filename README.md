## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Utilized

* **Python:** The core programming language for backend logic and machine learning.
* **FastAPI:** Powers the high-performance API for efficient data processing.
* **Streamlit:** Facilitates the creation of an interactive and user-friendly web interface.
* **Newspaper3k:** For robust and efficient news article web scraping.

## üöÄ Getting Started (Development)

To set up and run the application locally, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/samuel-oluwemimo/fake_news_and_summarization_app.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Train Machine Learning Models:**
    If you've made changes to the models or need to retrain them, run:
    * **Classification Model:**
        ```bash
        python ml/classification/train.py
        ```
    * **Summarization Model:**
        ```bash
        python ml/summarization/train.py
        ```

2.  **Run the FastAPI Backend:**
    This will start the API server, typically on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
    ```bash
    fastapi dev app/main.py
    ```

3.  **Launch the Streamlit Frontend:**
    Open a *new* terminal window (keeping the FastAPI server running) and run:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app/app.py
    ```
    This will open the web application in your default browser, usually at `http://localhost:8501`.
